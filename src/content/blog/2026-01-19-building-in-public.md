## A Fresh Start

After years of building software for others, I'm carving out time to work on my own projects. This blog will document that journey - the wins, the struggles, and everything in between.

## What I'm Building

I'm currently working on three projects:

### White Label Reviews
A reputation management platform for small businesses. The idea came from watching local businesses struggle to compete with larger companies in managing their online presence.

### Idealeet
An AI-powered landing page generator. The goal is to make it dead simple for entrepreneurs to create professional landing pages without needing design or coding skills.

### Lidger
A personal dashboard combining goals, tasks, health tracking, and habits. This one's for me - I got tired of having my life scattered across a dozen different apps.

## Why Build in Public?

A few reasons:

1. **Accountability** - It's easy to abandon side projects. Writing about them creates external pressure to keep going.

2. **Learning** - Explaining things forces clearer thinking. If I can't explain a decision, maybe it wasn't well thought out.

3. **Connection** - Maybe someone else is building something similar. Maybe someone will find these notes useful.

## What's Next

I'll be posting updates as I make progress on these projects. Technical deep-dives, product decisions, lessons learned - all of it.

Let's build.
