        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Systems Over Tickets</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          I think in systems, not isolated features. Every change is an opportunity to improve the whole, not just close
          a ticket. Understanding how pieces connect leads to better decisions.

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Clarity From Ambiguity</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Many projects fail from unclear requirements, not technical challenges. I turn fuzzy problems into clear plans
          that teams can execute against.
        </p>

      <Card>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Trade-offs Over Perfection</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Perfect is the enemy of shipped. I make explicit trade-offs, document them, and move forward. The goal is the
          right solution for now, not an imaginary ideal.
        </p>

      <Card>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Maintainability</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Code is read far more than it's written. I optimize for the team that will maintain this code in six months.
          Which is often future me.
        </p>

      <Card>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Reliability & Observability</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          If it's not observable, it's not reliable. I build systems that tell you when something is wrong before users
          notice, with clear paths to diagnosis.
        </p>

      <Card>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Economic Thinking</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Engineering is about allocating limited resources over time, attention, and compute. I weigh effort against
          value and choose the path that maximizes impact.
